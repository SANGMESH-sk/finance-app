                        <p style={{fontSize:'18px'}}>Life insurance refers to the legally binding contract and an insurance company that provides financial protection to his/her family. The insurer promises to offer the insurance benefit in exchange for regular premiums paid by the life insured. The ‘financial protection’ under life insurance is provided in the form of life cover, also known as sum assured. It is a pre-agreed amount that is payable in case of an untoward incident with the life insured.
